# GettingStartedWith_SpringBoot
Learning the basics of Spring Boot

This was done in Linux Mint so I can't really help if you run on a different OS.

## Link to the tutorial:
https://www.springboottutorial.com/creating-rest-service-with-spring-boot

## TL;DR:
- What is it?
> Hard to explain. But it's a tool that offers a fast way to build applications, focusing on managing the bulk of infrastrucutre for you so that you can focus more on your application.

> In this tutorial it is built a basic RESTful Service using Spring Boot. RESTful Services are services based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture.

- Spring Initializr:
> Tool that bootstraps and allows you to download your basic Spring Boot project.

> Some of the packages that are commonly bootstrapped for the most basic (-ish) uses:
>> Web, Actuator, DevTools, H2, Lombok

- Basic Structure:
> Controller: TBD

> Service: TBD

> Model: the modeling of the classes/tables in your database. It's the coded representation of persisted data.
