# GettingStartedWith_SpringBoot
Learning the basics of Spring Boot

This was done in Linux Mint so I can't really help if you run on a different OS.

## Link to the tutorial:
https://www.springboottutorial.com/creating-rest-service-with-spring-boot

## TL;DR:
- What is it?
> Hard to explain. But it's a tool that offers a fast way to build applications, managing the bulk of infrastrucutre, allowing you to focus more on your application.

> In this tutorial it is built a basic RESTful Service using Spring Boot. RESTful Services are services based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture.

- Spring Initializr:
> Tool that bootstraps and allows you to download your basic Spring Boot project.

> Some of the packages that are commonly bootstrapped for the most basic (-ish) uses:
>> Web, Actuator, DevTools, H2, Lombok

- Basic Structure:
> Model: the modeling of the classes/tables in your database. It's the coded representation of persisted data.

> Controller: the endpoints (i.e. the URL and mappings of the request). It's how you'll make the requests to the server.

> Service: it's where the business rules are applied. Basically what goes where, how and why.

> DAO: the raw connection to the data source (more often than not databases).
